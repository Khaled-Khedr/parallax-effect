Please use Visual Studio Code to see my website !
Extract task2.rar then open the folder in vs studio code ( I have uploaded all files and images seperately as well)
To visualize the website go to extensions and download Live Server
Install it
Read the Instructions on the extension page (go to html file and right click then open with live server) or press on the go live icon on the bottom right
Thank you for your attention!
